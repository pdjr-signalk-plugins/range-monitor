# signalk-threshold-notifier

A [Signal K Node Server](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node) plugin
which raises notifications based on the values of one or more monitored Signal
K paths.

Thanks are due to Scott Bender for his
[signalk-simple-notifications](https://github.com/sbender9/signalk-simple-notifications)
plugin which this work simply elaborates.
