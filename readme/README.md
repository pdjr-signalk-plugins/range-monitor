# signalk-threshold-notifier

[Signal K Node Server](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node) plugin
which raises notifications based on one or more path values.

The real-time values of one or more user-specified paths are compared against
user-defined thresholds and Signal K notifications raised as these boundaries
are encountered. 

Thanks are due to Scott Bender for his
[signalk-simple-notifications](https://github.com/sbender9/signalk-simple-notifications)
plugin which this work simply elaborates.
